# hello-world
Following the tutorial

I am a new programmer. I have dated experience with Java, I have more recent experience with MATLAB, but currently I am going to be learning the in's and out's of Python. My goal is two-fold. My most immediate goal is to learn how to code! My previous exposure to the world of coding/programming was postive and I enjoyed the process immensely. Some say that if you love to do something then you should never do it for free. My second goal, and most importantly, is to turn this into a career. I'd like to create a portfolio of programs and, if possible, earn a certificate or some degree to make my prospects more attainable. I'm rambling, but I'm very excited!
